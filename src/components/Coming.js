            <h1>Frax.io is in Production</h1>
            <p>Frax.io is a Marketplace for Interactive Fractional NFT's</p>
            <h3>Create Pyenamic Oracle Fed Animations !</h3>
            <p>Pyenamic NFT's are fed by the Chainlink Oracles and are capable of animating graphics and images saved on IPFS,
            distributed on multiple layers, and interacting with real world data.
            Pyenaic NFT's have Programmable Action Keys that are triggerd by real word data events.
            </p>
            <h3>Fractionize your PYE Tokens</h3>
            <p>Your digital Interctive Artwork can be saved as unique PYE Token in ERC721 Standard.
            This PYE Token can be split into a custom amount of Artwork specific FRX Tokens in ERC20 Standard.
            The Artist can choose to fractionize from 1 - 9999 FRX from one PYE and and even
            create a Liquidity Pool of his Fractionized Artwork.
            </p>
            <h3>The Freezer</h3>
            <p>
                In Order to sell your FRX Tokens you need to Freeze your PYE Token as Collateral
                You can even choose to add any ERC20, ERC721 funding to either peg the value of the PYE in some fashion
                Or to Group several PYEs or Stack PYEs with foreign AddOn NFTs. You are now allowed to Mint your Artworks
                FRX Tokens and add them to the Marketplace.
            </p>
            <h3>The Marketplace</h3>
            <p>
                If you have Fractionized and Frozen your Artwork you can now create a Custom Bid Auction or a simple Sale.
                Any body that owns 100% of the FRX Tokens of your Artwork can unfreeze the actual PYE Token that they are backed by.
            </p>
